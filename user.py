class User:

    USER WILL BE A CLASS CONTAINING THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE USER

    CLASS USER
    -self.name -> name of the user
    -self.surname -> surname of the user
    -self.mail -> mail of the user
    -self.id -> id of user
    -self.salt -> salt (is it more convenient to use rand instead of uuid4?)
    -self.h_pw -> hashed password of the user
    -self.organization -> Organization which the user belongs to
    -self.trust -> trust level of the level
    -self.username -> username of the user

    -METHODS:
         1. get_name -> get the name of the user
         2. get_surname -> get surname pf the user
         3. get mail -> get mail of the user
         4. get_id -> get id of the user
         5. get_trust -> get trust level of the user
         6. set_pw_hash -> set new hashed password
         7. verify_pw -> method taking as argument a string verifying the validity of a password
         8. get_user -> get user data in form of a namedtuple

    -INITIALIZATION:
         1. name -> name of the user
         2. surname -> surname of the user
         3. organization -> Organization which the user belongs to
         4. mail -> mail of the user
         5. pw -> password of the user
         6. trust -> trust level of the user
         7. id -> user id, if not provided it is created
         8. user_data -> named tuple, if it is not none the class is initialized with its values
